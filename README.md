## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## New Services

Run `ng g service <name>` and move the service to app/services.
Then, add the service to app/app.module.ts providers section and import the place where you need it

## New components

You can install new angular2 components via npm, look at the npmjs page for that. If you want to use
them afterwards, do the import statement at the place where you need it and insert into the constructor.
